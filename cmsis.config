# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.

RECURSIVE              = YES

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should be
# excluded from the INPUT source files. This way you can easily exclude a
# subdirectory from a directory tree whose root is specified with the INPUT tag.
#
# Note that relative paths are relative to the directory from which doxygen is
# run.

EXCLUDE                =

# that contain example code fragments that are included (see the \include
# command).

# If the value of the EXAMPLE_PATH tag contains directories, you can use the
# EXAMPLE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp and
# *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left blank all
# files are included.

EXAMPLE_PATTERNS       =

# If the EXAMPLE_RECURSIVE tag is set to YES then subdirectories will be

# \image command).

IMAGE_PATH             =

# The INPUT_FILTER tag can be used to specify a program that doxygen should
# invoke to filter for each input file. Doxygen will invoke the filter program
# by executing (via popen()) the command:
#
# <filter> <input-file>
#
# where <filter> is the value of the INPUT_FILTER tag, and <input-file> is the
# name of an input file. Doxygen will then use the output that the filter
# program writes to standard output. If FILTER_PATTERNS is specified, this tag
# will be ignored.
#
# Note that the filter must not add or remove lines; it is applied before the
# code is scanned, but not when the output code is generated. If lines are added
# or removed, the anchors will not be placed correctly.

INPUT_FILTER           =

# The FILTER_PATTERNS tag can be used to specify filters on a per file pattern
# basis. Doxygen will compare the file name with each pattern and apply the
# filter if there is a match. The filters are a list of the form: pattern=filter
# (like *.cpp=my_cpp_filter). See INPUT_FILTER for further information on how
# filters are used. If the FILTER_PATTERNS tag is empty or if none of the
# patterns match the file name, INPUT_FILTER is applied.

# If the FILTER_SOURCE_FILES tag is set to YES, the input filter (if set using
# INPUT_FILTER) will also be used to filter the input files that are used for
# producing the source files to browse (i.e. when SOURCE_BROWSER is set to YES).
# The default value is: NO.

FILTER_SOURCE_FILES    = NO

# The FILTER_SOURCE_PATTERNS tag can be used to specify source filters per file
# pattern. A pattern will override the setting for FILTER_PATTERN (if any) and
# it is also possible to disable source filtering for a specific pattern using
# *.ext= (so without naming a filter).
# This tag requires that the tag FILTER_SOURCE_FILES is set to YES.
