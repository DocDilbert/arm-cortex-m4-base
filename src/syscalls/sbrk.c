/// @brief Increase program data space.
///
/// The _sbrk( ) function adds incr bytes to the break value and changes the allocated space
/// accordingly. If incr is negative, the amount of allocated space is decreased by incr bytes. The
/// current value of the program break is returned by sbrk(0).
///
/// @param incr Number of increments which should be added to the break value
///
/// @returns Upon successful completion, sbrk( ) returns the prior break value. Otherwise, it returns
///          (void *)âˆ’1 and sets errno to indicate the error.
