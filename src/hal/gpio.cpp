/// File containing the gpio hardware abstraction.

/// Each cortex-m4 based microcontroller has its own way dealing with gpios. The functions
/// in this file should deliver an hardware independent interface to access these. 
///
/// This file is written for the spansion/cypress MB9BF568R. But is should be easily
/// adaptable to other microcontrollers.
